There is a saying that goes:

> You can't win a game you don't know how to play...

The purpose of this page is to teach the rules of
JavaScript, and in some cases programming in general,
so one can feel confident reading and writing code! Follow these rules
and you will be coding with confidence like an expert! The best way to learn is practice
and just doing it for a long time.
