                  <p>
                    In object-oriented programming, an object is simply a data structure.
                    Data structures are used for holding, organizing, and manipulating data/information.
                    Essentially, objects have <strong>state</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong>.
                    Objects have a collection of information associated with it, which are known as <strong>properties</strong>.
                    When a <strong>property</strong> is a behavior(a.k.a function), it is called a <strong>method</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <strong>state</strong> is the current information an object holds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <strong>behavior</strong> are the methods that an object can perform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <strong>methods</strong> are often, if not all the time, defined to <strong>access/manipulate/modify the state</strong> of the object.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here is an analogy: a phone is an object; it has state and behavior.
                    For example, some of the state a phone can have is it's color, model, carrier, size, brand, etc.
                    Phones can also do things, like call and text.

                  <p>
                    You can access an object's property by using the dot notation or the bracket notation. For Example:

                    Everything in JavaScript is an object, however there are different <strong><em>types</em></strong> of objects to represent different types of information.
                    For example, letters are different than numbers and numbers are different than dates.
                    Although there may be different types of objects, they all work the same due to being based on the same foundation; they have state and behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are built-in object types, such as object literal, arrays, and dates. You can also define your own types of objects!

                    In object-oriented programming, objects are created from a
                    <code>class</code>. A class is a blueprint from with an object type is
                    created from. For example, imagine a blueprint for a house. Multiple
                    houses can be created using the same blueprint.
                    The different houses may have different furniture(information) in them
                    but they all have/share the same structure(class). A class can be created from another class,
                    this is called <strong>"sub-class"</strong>. That sub-class will inherit all of the properties from it's "<strong>parent-class"</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A class outlines the properties(state and behavior) that an object will have.
                    An object is an instances of a class.

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                    In JavaScript, objects are not created from a class because
                    JavaScript does not follow the class concept. Rather, in JavaScript,
                    objects are created from something called a Prototype.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In class based languages, objects cannot be <em>extended</em> after they are created.
                    By extended, i mean they can only have the properties defined in its class;
                    it cannot be assigned any more properties after being instantiated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In JavaScript, any object can have whatever properties a developer decides to give it;
                    there is no required convention to follow and no requirement to have only what was defined in its prototype.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the way JavaScript behaves, it is often referred to as
                    a loosely-typed/weak language.

                  <p>
                    There are things in programming called <strong>primitives</strong>.
                    A primitive is data that is not an object and has no state/behavior; they are incapable of being changed.
                    For example, there is a primitive called <strong>Boolean</strong>.
                    A boolean is like a switch, it can only be 1 of 2 values: yes or no, on or off.
                    In programming, the two Boolean values are <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.
                    True will always be true and false will always be false.
                    Numbers are primitives too: 1 will always be 1 and 2 will always be 2.
                    There is nothing that can change that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This somewhat hinders the learning and understanding of objects in programming(JS in particular)
                    because <em>everything</em> is considered an object, including numbers, but number are also considered a primitive, which cannot change.
                    The reason JS also considers a number an object is because there is something specific to that language, called <strong>constructor function</strong>.
                    Basically, there is a wrapper on top of primitives that allows them to work like objects, having state and behavior.

                    Variables are defined using a variable keyword, then giving a name, then optionally assigning a value.
                    Variables are created by using one of the following keywords: <a title="var, let, or const" href="https://dzone.com/articles/javascript-difference-between-var-let-and-const-ke">var, let, or const</a>.
                    For example:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="well">
                    var name = 'Ryan';
                    let age;
                  </pre>
                </div>
              </div>

                  <p>
                    After a variable has been created, it can have a diferent value at a different time. For example:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="well">
                    var name = 'Ryan';

                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    Notice how there were no keywords involved with re-assigning a value.
                    That is because the variable was already defined.

                    reserved for creating variables. If you were to create a variable with the name "var",
                    the language would not know if you wanted to create a variabled or call the name of one.

                    Functions don't have to return anything when being defined. In that case, JavaScript will return <code>undefined</code> by default. So in theory, all functions will return <em>something</em>.

                    Functions can accept many inputs, but only return 1 value.
                    This is because the return keyword stops a function exection
                    from continuing past where that return keyword was used. For Example
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In the above example, the <code>double_num</code> function was only <em>defined</em>, meaning it was created and designed on what it will do.
                    It won't run until it gets <strong>called</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To call a function, use its name followed by parenthesis. For example:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="well">
                    double_num(2);
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    Notice the value in the parenthesis, it is an actual value.
                    When the function <code>double_num</code> was defined, it was defined by accepting an input, called number.
                    That is just a reference to a value that gets inputted to the function <em>when</em> it gets called.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The returned value can also be stored in a variable at the time of it being defined. For Example:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="well">
                    var numberFour = double_num(2);
                  </pre>

                      var numberTrippled = triple_num(number);
                      return numberTrippled * numberTrippled;
                    }

                    Notice how <strong>triple_num</strong> was being called within <strong>square_trippled_num</strong>.

                    Every time you call a variable, you get the value that it holds.
                    Every time you call a function, you get what was returned.
                    If you know the object being return, you can <em>chain</em> on a property or method call!
                    jQuery does this heavily: For example:

                    In programming, things happen in order and you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task; that is called <strong>synchronous</strong>.
                    Tasks can happen outside of an order, that is called <strong>asynchronous</strong>.
                    One cannot "wait" for an asynchronous because the order would have continued on when an asynchronous code is executed.
